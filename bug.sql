In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column. For example, if you try to store a large integer value in a small integer column, you'll get an error. Similarly, if you try to insert text data into a numeric column, you'll encounter issues. This can also cause unexpected behavior if the data type is not correctly matched to the operation or query performed.  Another subtle issue is incorrect use of aggregate functions in the `GROUP BY` clause. For instance, using a column not included in `GROUP BY` without an aggregate function will lead to unpredictable results depending on the specific SQL dialect.  Finally, subtle issues can arise from implicit data type conversions. The database may perform implicit type conversions that lead to unexpected results or errors if not handled properly.
