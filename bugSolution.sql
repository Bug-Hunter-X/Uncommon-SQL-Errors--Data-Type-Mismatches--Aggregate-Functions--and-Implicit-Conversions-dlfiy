To avoid data type errors, carefully select the appropriate data type for each column based on the expected data. Use explicit type casting when performing operations involving different data types. To prevent issues with aggregate functions and `GROUP BY`, ensure that all columns in the `SELECT` list are either included in the `GROUP BY` clause or are aggregated using functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, or `COUNT`.  For implicit type conversions, be aware of how your specific SQL dialect handles them and explicitly cast data types when necessary to avoid unexpected behavior.  Always validate and test your queries to prevent unforeseen consequences.
